# Part Entry Standards

## Introduction
Welcome to the FabLab Part Entry standards document! Here we will outline everything about how parts are entered into our monolithic KiCAD library.

## How to properly add a part in the KiCAD library
### Standard Components
Definition: Compliance with international stardard associations such as IEEE.  
Examples:
- Resistor: 10k 0402
- Capacitor: 100nF 0603
- Diodes

### Non-standard Components
Examples:
- ADCs
- Specialised Amplifiers
- Radio Transeivers

This is the long bit... Here will outline the basic description and tags you should include in your component entry, any parameters that aren't described in the datasheet can be left out
